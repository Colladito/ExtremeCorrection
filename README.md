# Extreme Correction

This repository contains the complete code for the Extreme Correction technique, along with example notebooks that demonstrate its usage. The Extreme Correction method is designed to correct extreme value data, particularly focusing on significant wave height (Hs) datasets.

## Repository Structure
- `src/extremecorrection.py`: This file contains the core implementation of the Extreme Correction technique. The provided class performs the correction without dividing the data into clusters (Weather Types - WT).

- `Notebooks/Examples/Hs.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates the application of the correction technique using both corrected and simulated Hs data. The step-by-step process illustrates how the method refines extreme value estimates.

- `Figures/Hs_Complete/`: The corrected figures generated by the class are stored in this folder, providing visual insight into the results.


## Example Workflow

The correction process typically involves the following steps:

- Load your dataset (e.g., Hs data).
- Instantiate the `Gev_ExtremeCorrection` class.
- Fit the model to the data and apply the correction.
- Generate and analyze the corrected figures, which will be saved automatically in the selected folder.
